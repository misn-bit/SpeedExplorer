# SpeedExplorer

SpeedExplorer is a purely vibe-coded Windows file manager replacement. As in, it's fully written by AI, under my "guidance". 

Initial idea was simply: "Hmmm. What can i do with these AI agents? Well, i kinda hate the windows file explorer because it's slow at times. Sure, why not, let's vibe-code a file explorer."

So, here we are. The app is focused on enabling you to do navigation and simple file operations quickly and frictionlessly. Has tabs, search, hotkeys, and custom hotkey mappings for most actions. Also features in-app tagging of files, and a "search only by tags" feature.

Also has optional "experimental" local AI assistant integration that lets your locally ran AI manage your files. This feature is currently quite limited. In current state, requires LMStudio 0.4.0 or higher with local server enabled and a reasonably big/smart model downloaded and loaded, such as gpt-oss-20b. I tried to make sure it can't be destructive, but do exercise caution.
A slightly more interesting feature of AI integration - Batch AI image processing that can tag images for you, or save image descriptions in a .txt based on your prompt. Requires a model that has vision capabilities - such as qwen3-vl-4b or better.

## Caution

The app is provided "AS IS", without warranties.
I don't know how to code. As such, i did not review the code of this program. The code of the program is fully written by AI.
