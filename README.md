**SpeedExplorer** is a purely vibe-coded Windows file manager replacement. As in, it’s fully written by AI agents under my guidance.

The app is focused on enabling you to navigate and perform simple file operations quickly and frictionlessly.

The initial idea was simply: “Hmmm. What can I do with these AI agents? Well, I kind of hate the Windows File Explorer because it’s slow at times. Sure, why not - let’s vibe-code a file explorer.” So here we are.

If you're wondering if i even use the app myself - yes, i do. I've been using it by default for a little bit now. It's fleshed out enough to not make me want to go back to the windows file explorer.

## Main Features

*   **Fast Navigation:** Optimized for speed and low friction.
*   **Tabbed Interface:** Manage multiple folders in one window.
*   **Search & Hotkeys:** Full keyboard support with custom mapping capabilities.
*   **Tagging System:** In-app file tagging and a "search by tags" mode.


## AI Integration (Experimental)

SpeedExplorer features an optional local AI assistant that runs on your own hardware.

*   **Chat with your files:** Let the AI manage or organize files (limited functionality to prevent accidents).
*   **Batch Image Processing:** Automatically tag images, get text from images or generate text descriptions based on visual content.

### Requirements for AI features:
*   **Software:** LM Studio 0.4.0+ (with Local Server enabled).
*   **Models:**
    *   *For General Logic:* A decent size model (e.g., `gpt-oss-20b`).
    *   *For Vision/Images:* A vision-capable model (e.g., `qwen3-vl-4b` or better).

> **Note:** AI features are non-destructive by default, but please exercise caution when allowing an LLM to manage file operations.
